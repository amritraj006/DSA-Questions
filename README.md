# 📘 DSA Questions

This repository contains my solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems.  
I’m solving these questions to strengthen my problem-solving skills, prepare for coding interviews, and build a strong foundation in computer science.

---

## 🔥 What’s Inside
- 📝 **C++ solutions** for a variety of DSA problems
- 📂 Organized by topics (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.)
- 🚀 Continuously updated as I solve more problems

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Practice important DSA patterns (two pointers, sliding window, binary search, recursion, DP, etc.)
- Improve coding speed and accuracy
- Prepare for technical interviews at top companies
